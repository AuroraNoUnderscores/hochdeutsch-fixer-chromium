# Hochdeutsch-Fixer

A Chromium extension (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi) that rewrites Swiss
Standard German on web pages into German Standard German — optionally with a Hamburg accent. Rules do the work; a small
German language model running on your own machine settles the calls rules can't make.

## Install

`chrome://extensions` → turn on Developer mode → Load unpacked → pick this
folder. It stays installed across restarts. Chrome may warn about an unpacked
extension on each start; packing it (Pack extension, which produces a .crx and
a key) or publishing it to the Web Store silences that.

This is the Chromium port of
[hochdeutsch-fixer](https://github.com/AuroraNoUnderscores/hochdeutsch-fixer),
which is the Firefox build. Everything that decides what gets rewritten is the
same file on both sides.

## What the port changes

Chromium needs a different shell around the same logic:

| | Firefox build | this build |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manifest | v2 | v3 (Chrome dropped v2) |
| API namespace | `browser.*` | `chrome.*`, bridged by `compat.js` |
| Model host | persistent background page | offscreen document (`offscreen.js`) |
| Messaging | listener returns a promise | `sendResponse` + `return true` |
| Icons | `icon.svg` | `icon16/48/128.png` |

`compat.js` maps `browser.*` onto `chrome.*` and translates promise-returning
message listeners into Chromium's `sendResponse` form, which is why
`content.js`, `popup.js`, `engine.js`, `morph.js`, `dictionary.js` and `llm.js`
are byte-identical to the Firefox repo and can be copied straight across:

```bash
bash sync.sh ../hochdeutsch-fixer     # pull shared files from the Firefox repo
```

A service worker cannot hold the model — Chromium stops it when idle, which
would drop ~92 MB of weights every time — so `background.js` only relays
ranking requests to an offscreen document, where the model stays loaded.

## How it works

Two passes over every text node:

1. **Rules** (`dictionary.js`, `morph.js`, `engine.js`) — run instantly. Where
   they can't decide, they emit a *choice*: a list of candidate strings with a
   safe default, so the page always reads correctly.
2. **The baby LLM** (`llm.js`, hosted by `background.js`) — a German DistilBERT
   (66M parameters, int8, ~92 MB), downloaded once from Hugging Face on first
   use and cached. It scores each candidate sentence by pseudo-log-likelihood
   (mask a token, ask how likely it is) and the best one replaces the default.

The model never writes text. It only ranks candidates the rules produced, so the
worst it can do is pick the wrong one of them. It runs on WASM, no GPU needed.

### Text about words is left alone

A page explaining that "Mass (1) und Masse (2) werden in der Mehrzahl zu Massen"
must keep its examples, and so must "in der Schweiz sagt man Velo". No model can
catch this — both spellings read perfectly naturally — so it is detected instead,
at three levels, each reverting anything already changed:

- **Page**: a strong cue (Rechtschreibung, Eszett, Duden, Grammatik, Helvetismus …)
  or two weaker ones in the title and text switch the extension off for the page.
  The popup then says so.
- **Sentence**: one cue (das Wort, Mehrzahl, sagt man, Aussprache …) suppresses
  that sentence only, so a single explaining line in an ordinary article is safe.
- **Word**: a word in quotes («Velo»), or inside `em`/`i`/`q`/`cite`/`dfn` with
  at most three words, is being named rather than used. A word is also left alone
  when the other spelling appears nearby, since the text is comparing them.

### What each side decides

| Decision | Who | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vocabulary, compounds, numbers, known ß stems | rules | unambiguous |
| Articles, adjective endings, case and number after a gender change | rules, model picks when the case is ambiguous ("ein Keks" vs "einen Keks") | |
| ß for any other word (Masse/Maße, Floss/Floß) | model | needs the context |
| Words that are also German with another meaning (Busse, Finken, tönen) | cue words in the surrounding block, else the model | the model only judges how a sentence sounds and cannot know a page is about speeding fines |
| "zügeln" → "umziehen", incl. moving the particle to the clause end | model | word order |
| parkiert → parkt / geparkt | rules | the model scores "Er geparkt das Auto" higher, so it is not asked |
| Pronouns after a gender change ("Er war knapp" → "Sie war knapp") | rules | German pronouns agree with their antecedent; the model has no idea |

## Settings (toolbar popup)

- **Enabled**, and a per-site switch. Turning it off restores the page without a reload.
- **Flavour**: *Hamburg* (default — Rundstück, Sonnabend, Schlachter, Tischler,
  Abendbrot, Deern, Jung, schnacken, Moin, Tschüss) or *Neutral* (plain German
  Standard German).
- **Baby LLM**: off = rules only, no download, no model.

## Adding words

Edit `dictionary.js`, then hit Reload in `about:debugging`.

- Nouns: `'Swiss/gender/plural = German/gender/plural | flags'`. Gender `m/f/n`,
  or `p` for plural-only; plural `-` means uncountable. Flags: `s` (also matches
  at the end of a compound), `sw`/`gw` (weak masculine), `gen=Form`, `x=regex`
  (compound exceptions). Genders matter: they drive the article rewriting.
- Everything else: `'swiss,forms>german,forms'` in `words`, `ambiguous` for
  words the model should judge, `phrases` for multi-word ones.
- `cues`: words that decide an ambiguous case before the model is asked.
  `pro` picks the German replacement, `contra` keeps the original — both are
  regexes matched against the text node and the block around it. This is how
  "die Bussen für zu schnelles Fahren" becomes Geldstrafen while "die Bussen ab
  dem Bahnhof" stays buses.

## Tests

Served over HTTP (`py -m http.server 8766` in this folder):

- `test.html` — rules only, no model, 67 cases.
- `dev/e2e.html` — rules + model, 15 cases.
- `dev/page.html` — the real content script on a page, with the extension API stubbed.
- `dev/bg.html` — background page: model loading, ranking, caching.
- `dev/chch.html` — a real page (ch.ch speeding fines) run through the content
  script, printing a before/after diff.
- `dev/meta.html` — a real page about the words themselves (verstaendlich.ch on
  Mass/Masse/Massen), which must come out unchanged.
- `dev/debug.html` — prints raw scores for candidate sentences.
- `dev/chromium.html` — the compat shim, plus a real ranking round-trip through
  the service worker and the offscreen document with the `chrome` API stubbed.

`test.js` also runs under `node test.js` if Node is available.

## Known limits

- Only the text you can see is changed; inputs and code blocks are left alone.
- Language: text under `lang="de"` is always processed. Elsewhere — including a
  German email inside an English webmail interface, where `lang` describes the
  interface and not the message — a block is processed when its own text reads
  as German (common German words, umlauts). Short fragments on pages with no
  German around them are left alone.
- Pronoun agreement is only fixed when nothing else could be the antecedent; it
  stops at the next noun, so a distant reference stays as it was.
- The model is small. It is good at spelling, articles and word choice in a
  sentence, and knows nothing about the world beyond that.
- The language-page detection is deliberately eager: a page that discusses
  spelling in passing is left untouched entirely, which is the safer of the two
  mistakes. The popup tells you when that is why nothing changed.
- First use downloads ~92 MB. Until it finishes, choices keep their defaults.
