# Hochdeutsch-Fixer

A Chromium extension (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi) that rewrites Swiss
Standard German on web pages into German Standard German — optionally with a Hamburg accent. Rules do the work; a small
German language model running on your own machine settles the calls rules can't make.

## Install

`chrome://extensions` → turn on Developer mode → Load unpacked → pick this
folder. It stays installed across restarts.

This is the Chromium port of
[hochdeutsch-fixer](https://github.com/AuroraNoUnderscores/hochdeutsch-fixer),
the Firefox build, where the model training lives (`training/`). Everything that
decides what gets rewritten, including the bundled model, is identical on both
sides and copied across with `bash sync.sh ../hochdeutsch-fixer`.

## What the port changes

| | Firefox build | this build |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manifest | v2 | v3 (Chrome dropped v2) |
| API namespace | `browser.*` | `chrome.*`, bridged by `compat.js` |
| Model host | persistent background page | offscreen document (`offscreen.js`) |
| Messaging | listener returns a promise | `sendResponse` + `return true` |
| Icons | `icon.svg` | `icon16/48/128.png` |

A service worker cannot hold the models — Chromium stops it when idle — so
`background.js` relays ranking requests to an offscreen document, where they
stay loaded.

## How it works

Two passes over every text node:

1. **Rules** (`dictionary.js`, `morph.js`, `engine.js`) run instantly: vocabulary,
   grammar, article agreement, and a first guess at every ss/ß. The page always
   reads sensibly before any model has spoken.
2. **Two small models** (`llm.js`, hosted by `offscreen.js`), both German
   DistilBERT running locally on WASM, no GPU needed:
   - **eszett** — fine-tuned for this extension to decide, for every "ss", whether
     German spells it ß, and which words are part of a name. Bundled in
     `models/hdfx-eszett` (64 MB). It reads each text once and answers both for
     all of it. How it was trained is in [training/](https://github.com/AuroraNoUnderscores/hochdeutsch-fixer/tree/main/training).
   - **general** — the untouched base model, downloaded once (~92 MB), which only
     ranks the few remaining candidates: article forms and grammar wording.

Neither model writes text: they choose among spellings and candidates the rules
produced.

### Why a trained model decides ss/ß, not rules

On sentences from articles nobody tuned anything on, hand-written ss/ß rules got
28.8 of every 1000 decisions wrong. The eszett model is trained on 23 million
sentences whose correct spelling came for free (turn every ß into ss, and the
original is the answer): German Wikipedia plus everyday German from the web,
cleaned of Swiss and misspelt pages. On held-out web text it gets 3.98 of 1000
wrong, on held-out Wikipedia 5.66, including the collisions a list cannot settle:
*die Masse strömte* vs *die Maße des Fensters*, *ein Ass* vs *ich aß*, *keine
Busse fahren* vs *eine Buße zahlen*. Wikipedia alone was not enough: an
encyclopedia hardly ever takes the measurements of a window.

The rules' answer only stands where the model is unsure (probability between 0.4
and 0.6), and a topic cue only outranks it for a spelling the model barely saw in
training (`coverage.js`: plural "Bußen" occurred 3 times). On unseen text the
cues are otherwise less reliable than the model.

### Names are left alone

"Herr Weiss" is not "Herr Weiß", the "Heiligen-Geist-Spital" is no
"Heiligen-Geist-Krankenhaus", and "Lucie Poulet" keeps her surname. The eszett
model also marks names (people, organisations, places, titles), trained on
GermEval 2014 and on web sentences with Swiss words swapped in, so that "im Spital"
still becomes "im Krankenhaus" while "Kinderspital Zürich" stays. Any word the
rules changed goes back when the model says it is part of a name, and so does a
pronoun that only changed because of it. For ss/ß only people keep their
spelling: places, organisations and titles take ß like any word ("Bahnhofstraße",
"in Straßburg"). Keeping organisations and titles too measured 6.45 instead of
4.72 errors per 1000 on held-out web text, since German writes "Universitätsklinik
Gießen" and "Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz". The price: a company named after
someone ("Weiss AG") becomes "Weiß AG".

### Words that are German too

Some Swiss words are also ordinary German with another meaning: "am Rande" is not
beetroot, a "Store" is often a shop, "Entscheide dich" is a verb. Which dictionary
words those are was measured on a web crawl (`german_too.js`: about as common on
.de pages as on .ch pages). For them, and for a bare noun opening a sentence where
German puts verbs, the original stays a candidate and the general model keeps it
when it reads clearly better.

### Text about words is left alone

A page explaining that "Mass (1) und Masse (2) werden in der Mehrzahl zu Massen"
must keep its examples, and so must "in der Schweiz sagt man Velo". No model can
catch this — both spellings read perfectly naturally — so it is detected instead,
at three levels, each reverting anything already changed:

- **Page**: a strong cue (Rechtschreibung, Eszett, Duden, Grammatik, Helvetismus …)
  or two weaker ones in the title and text switch the extension off for the page.
  The popup then says so.
- **Sentence**: one cue (das Wort, Mehrzahl, sagt man, Aussprache …) suppresses
  that sentence only, so a single explaining line in an ordinary article is safe.
- **Word**: a word in quotes («Velo»), or inside `em`/`i`/`q`/`cite`/`dfn` with
  at most three words, is being named rather than used. A word is also left alone
  when the other spelling appears nearby, since the text is comparing them.

### What the general model is for

It ranks candidates by how natural they sound, and may only overrule a rule when
clearly better, by a margin in nats that depends on what is at stake (`CONF` in
`engine.js`): word choice 2.0, forms 0.5, grammar wording 0. Below that the rule's
default stands. The popup lists recent decisions with their margins, and "Baby
LLM" off turns both models off (rules only).

### Swiss grammar, not just words

Some Helvetisms are constructions rather than vocabulary:

| Swiss | German | how |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Es hat noch Tische frei | Es gibt noch freie Tische | rules rewrite, model picks the wording |
| Der Kollege, wo mir hilft | Der Kollege, der mir hilft | gender from the article, model picks the case |
| Ich bin gesessen / Er ist gestanden | Ich habe gesessen / Er hat gestanden | rules: position verbs take haben |

"es hat" only becomes "es gibt" where *es* is the subject and the clause holds no
participle, so "Es hat geregnet", "Sie hat es eilig" and "Er hat es mir gegeben"
are left alone. Relative "wo" after a place or a time ("die Stadt, wo ich wohne")
is ordinary German and stays.

### What each side decides

| Decision | Who | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vocabulary, compounds, numbers, known ß stems | rules | unambiguous |
| Articles, adjective endings, case and number after a gender change | rules, model picks when the case is ambiguous ("ein Keks" vs "einen Keks") | |
| every ss/ß | eszett model, rules where it is unsure | measured 5× fewer errors than rules on unseen text |
| Is a changed word part of a name? | eszett model | a name is a fact about the text, not the word |
| Dictionary words that are also German (Rande, Store, Estrich) | general model may keep the original | measured on a crawl which words these are |
| Words that are also German with another meaning (Busse, Finken, tönen) | cue words in the surrounding block, else the model | the model only judges how a sentence sounds and cannot know a page is about speeding fines |
| "zügeln" → "umziehen", incl. moving the particle to the clause end | model | word order |
| parkiert → parkt / geparkt | rules | the model scores "Er geparkt das Auto" higher, so it is not asked |
| Pronouns after a gender change ("Er war knapp" → "Sie war knapp") | rules | German pronouns agree with their antecedent; the model has no idea |

## Settings (toolbar popup)

- **Enabled**, and a per-site switch. Turning it off restores the page without a reload.
- **Flavour**: *Hamburg* (default — Rundstück, Sonnabend, Schlachter, Tischler,
  Abendbrot, Deern, Jung, schnacken, Moin, Tschüss) or *Neutral* (plain German
  Standard German).
- **Baby LLM**: off = rules only, no download, no model.
- **Highlight changes on page**: every changed word is tinted, and words the model
  kept because they are part of a name get a dotted blue underline. Uses CSS
  highlights, so the page's markup is not touched.
- **Show changed words**: the list of every change in the tab, all frames
  included ("Velo → Fahrrad ×4"), and the words kept as names.

## Adding words

Edit `dictionary.js`, then hit the reload icon in `chrome://extensions`.

- Nouns: `'Swiss/gender/plural = German/gender/plural | flags'`. Gender `m/f/n`,
  or `p` for plural-only; plural `-` means uncountable. Flags: `s` (also matches
  at the end of a compound), `sw`/`gw` (weak masculine), `gen=Form`, `x=regex`
  (compound exceptions). Genders matter: they drive the article rewriting.
- Everything else: `'swiss,forms>german,forms'` in `words`, `ambiguous` for
  words the model should judge, `phrases` for multi-word ones.
- `cues`: words that decide an ambiguous *vocabulary* case (Finken, Kasten,
  tönen) before the general model is asked. `pro` picks the German replacement,
  `contra` keeps the original — regexes matched against the sentence first, then
  the text node, then the block around it.
- `ssCues`: the same for ss-words with two real spellings (Busse/Buße,
  Masse/Maße). These are the rules' fallback: the eszett model decides, and a cue
  only outranks it for a spelling it barely saw in training, per `coverage.js`
  (regenerate with `training/coverage.py` after changing the cue words). That is
  how "die Bussen für zu schnelles Fahren" becomes Bußen.

## Tests

Served over HTTP (`py -m http.server 8766` in this folder):

- `test.html` — rules only, no model, 95 cases.
- `dev/margins.html` — how confident the general model is on every decision.
- `dev/heldout.html?llm=1` — the whole engine on held-out Wikipedia sentences
  (needs `training/data` from the Firefox repo), with errors split by whether the model or the rules decided.
- `dev/offsets.html`, `dev/parity.html` — the browser feeds the eszett model
  exactly as Python did in training, and gets the same probabilities.
- `dev/key.html` — the 44 notes of the test artifact against its answer key
  (`dev/corpus.js`), rules plus model; `?mode=neutral` for the other flavour,
  `?llm=0` for rules only.
- `dev/heldout.html?llm=1&set=web` (or `set=wiki`) — the engine on held-out web
  sentences from sites the model never saw (needs `training/data` from the Firefox
  repo), errors split by path.
- `dev/e2e.html` — rules + model, 21 cases.
- `dev/names.html` — names kept, ordinary words still changed, end to end.
- `dev/page.html` — the real content script on a page, with the extension API stubbed.
- `dev/changes.html` — the changed-words list and the highlights, end to end.
- `dev/popup.html` — the popup with made-up data, to look at it without the extension.
- `dev/chromium.html` — the compat shim, plus real ranking round-trips (general
  and eszett model, with names) through the service worker and the offscreen document.
- `dev/chch.html` — a real page (ch.ch speeding fines) run through the content
  script, printing a before/after diff.
- `dev/meta.html` — a real page about the words themselves (verstaendlich.ch on
  Mass/Masse/Massen), which must come out unchanged.
- `dev/frames.html` — a page of short notes inside a sandboxed `srcdoc`
  iframe, the shape artifacts and embedded readers use.
- `dev/debug.html` — prints raw scores for candidate sentences.

`test.js` also runs under `node test.js` if Node is available.

## Known limits

- Frames: the extension runs in iframes too, including the `srcdoc` and `blob`
  documents that artifacts and embedded readers use — those need an explicit
  opt-in (`match_about_blank`, and `match_origin_as_fallback` on Chromium),
  without which a browser injects nothing there. The popup adds up every frame
  in the tab and says how many frames changed something.
- Only the text you can see is changed; inputs and code blocks are left alone.
- Language: text under `lang="de"` is always processed. Elsewhere — including a
  German email inside an English webmail interface, where `lang` describes the
  interface and not the message — a block is processed when its own text reads
  as German (common German words, umlauts). Short fragments on pages with no
  German around them are left alone.
- Pronoun agreement is only fixed when nothing else could be the antecedent: it
  stops at the next noun, and in a following sentence only a pronoun that opens
  that sentence counts, so "… auf dem Trottoir. Weil es so heiss war" keeps its
  weather-"es".
- Capitalisation settles some ss/ß pairs by itself, with no model call: a noun is
  capitalised and a past tense is not, so mid-sentence "Ass" stays an ace while
  "ass" becomes "aß", and "Schoss" becomes "Schoß" while "schoss" stays.

- The model is small. It is good at spelling, articles and word choice in a
  sentence, and knows nothing about the world beyond that.
- The language-page detection is deliberately eager: a page that discusses
  spelling in passing is left untouched entirely, which is the safer of the two
  mistakes. The popup tells you when that is why nothing changed.
- The eszett model is bundled (64 MB); the general model downloads ~92 MB on first
  use. Until they answer, the rules' spellings stand.
- Names are only protected with Baby LLM on, and the rules' change shows for a
  moment before the model puts a name back.
- Name misses: brand names built from Swiss words (VeloStrom, "Velo Pro") and
  names with a letter or number ("Natel A") can still be rewritten. On a
  hand-labelled sample the model kept 21 of 30 such names and never kept an
  ordinary word.
- The model reads a paragraph at once. That usually helps, but in the long test
  note "die Masse der Zuschauer" early on pulls "die Masse meines Koffers" later
  to the crowd sense; and "Herzlichen Gruss aus Zürich" stays Gruss, because web
  pages write "Gruss" often enough to muddle the labels. 42 of the 44 test notes
  match their answer key.
